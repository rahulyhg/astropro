    Essential dignity makes little difference in contest charts. It is accidental dignity that counts in contest horaries.<br><br>
    
    Anyway, essential dignity doesn't much concern us in these charts. Accidental dignity and receptions. Let me repeat: ACCIDENTAL DIGNITY and RECEPTIONS.<br><br>
    
    Any planet in major essential dignity is benefic.<br><br>
