    Pluto has a powerful destructive effect if placed directly on a relevant cusp. If conjunct or opposing Fortuna, or the antiscion or the dispositor of Fortuna, this favors the underdog. In fact, Pluto seems to hold some kind of grudge against favorites - he's much less inclined to work his malice on the underdog. Even a placement on the 2nd cusp harms the favorites.<br><br>

    Uranus, if applying immediately to the MC, strongly favors the favorites, as also if he conjuncts Fortuna. Opposing Fortuna, he favors the underdog.<br><br>

    The orb allowed should be very close, a degree or so away at most.<br><br>

    Saturn, unless he is busy being Lord 1 or Lord 7, seems to work as a malefic, afflicting whatever he touches. This tendency to nastiness seems to take priority over other roles he might have, such as Lord 10.<br>
    Conjunctions, trines, and sextiles show things happening easily; squares and oppositions show them happening with difficulty.<br>
